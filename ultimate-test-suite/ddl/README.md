## Everything related to table creation, alteration, and deletion

Create table: primary key, unique, not null/null, default, check, foreign key, references (does this exist in TypeORM?). On update, on delete (no action, cascade, set null, restrict, set default). Index.

## Alter table

There's a lot of parameters and sub-commands with raw SQL, TODO: Look at what TypeORM is capable with.

## Drop table

???ы

## Truncate table

Looks like it has only one command with parameters.
